This is my first Milestone Project as part of the Code Institute's Diploma in Software Development

## Mark Cavendish - Professional Cyclist

This website is designed to profile the professional cyclist, Mark Cavendish. It offers users a consolidated platform to learn more about who Mark is, keep up-to-date with his racing schedule & results as the season progresses and get an insight into his life both on and off the bike, as documentated through his various social channels.

*NB for C.I. assessment purposes - it has been my intention to develop this website for a friend who is an up-and-coming semi-professional cyclist in Ireland. However, as a result of some unexpected personal circumstances I was unable to engage with him throughout the project duration, to consider content and obtain suitable images. I therefore retained the concept but pivoted my approach to producing a website for Mark Cavendish.*
