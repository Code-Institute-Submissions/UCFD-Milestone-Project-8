This is my first Milestone Project as part of the Code Institute's Diploma in Software Development

## Mark Cavendish - Professional Cyclist

This website is designed to profile the professional cyclist, Mark Cavendish. It offers users a platform to learn more about who Mark is, keep up-to-date with his racing schedule & results as the season progresses and get an insight into his life both on and off the bike, as documentated through his various social channels.

*NB for C.I. assessment purposes - it has been my intention to develop this website for a friend who is an up-and-coming semi-professional cyclist in Ireland. However, as a result of some unexpected personal circumstances I was unable to engage with him throughout the project duration, to consider content and obtain suitable images. I therefore retained the concept but pivoted my approach to producing a website for Mark Cavendish, given my own knowledge and readily available content/resources.*

## UX

The website has been designed for a range of users - from those who are cycling enthusiasts and fans of Mark Cavendish, to those who are trying to learn about who Mark is for the first time. Whatever the user background, they should hopefully find the website format engaging and east to navigate, and the content informative.

The consolidated platform enables users to learn about Mark's past success, follow his latest racing schedule, explore his social channels and, as appropriate, easily contact Mark to discuss the potential of a commercial partnership.
